# Title
Chris Barcala's Password Generator - Homework Assignment 3

# About
This application will prompt the user for specs and create a randomly generated password based on the user input.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN that a user needs a new, secure password

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN a password is generated

# How it works
    1. Has a Generate Password button to initiate script
    2. User is prompted for the length of characters they want the password to be between 8 and 128. Anything less or over results in having to click the button again.
    3. Once a successful lenght is entered, user is prompted whether they want or do not want the following options in their password:
        a. Special Characters
        b. Numbers
        c. lowercase Letters
        d. Uppercase Letters
    4. The script then creates a generated password meeting those specs and displays it in the center text field.
    5. The user has the option to copy the generated password to the clipboard and is alerted when doing so.
